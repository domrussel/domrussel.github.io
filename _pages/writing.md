I’m a PhD student at Harvard University studying Business Economics, a joint degree that combines the Economics Department’s PhD program with support from the Business School. I have also worked as a financial analyst at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a research assistant at NYU Stern, and a contractor with the Core Data Science team at Facebook.

If you'd like to learn more about me, you can find my CV [here][dr-cv].
