I’m a PhD candidate at Harvard University studying Business Economics, a joint degree that combines the Economics Department’s PhD program with support from the Business School. I'm an [NBER graduate fellow][https://www.nber.org/programs-projects/projects-and-centers/fellowships-consumer-financial-management/graduate-student-fellowships-consumer-financial-management-fellows] in consumer financial management and an affiliate with [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/). I have worked as a financial analyst at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a research assistant at NYU Stern, and a contractor with the Core Data Science team at Facebook. My research focuses on financial, behavioral, and public economics.

Above, you can find my research, CV, writing, and data visualization projects. I also co-host a lighthearted economics podcast, [Technically Economics][https://rss.com/podcasts/technically-economics/], with my classmate [Cassidy Shubatt][https://cshubatt.github.io/].
