I’m a PhD candidate at Harvard University studying Business Economics, a joint degree that combines the Economics Department’s PhD program with support from the Business School. I have worked as a financial analyst at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a research assistant at NYU Stern, and a contractor with the Core Data Science team at Facebook. My research focuses on financial, behavioral, and public economics.

Above, you can find my research, CV, writing, and data visualization projects.
