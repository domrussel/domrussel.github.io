Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in business economics at Harvard with interests in financial, behavioral, and public economics. I'm an [NBER graduate fellow](https://www.nber.org/programs-projects/projects-and-centers/fellowships-consumer-financial-management/graduate-student-fellowships-consumer-financial-management-fellows) in consumer financial management and an affiliate with [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/). I have worked as a financial analyst at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a research assistant at NYU Stern, and a contractor with the Core Data Science team at Facebook.

Above, you can find my research, CV, writing, and data visualization projects. I also co-host a lighthearted economics podcast, [Technically Economics](https://rss.com/podcasts/technically-economics/), with my classmate [Cassidy Shubatt](https://cshubatt.github.io/).
